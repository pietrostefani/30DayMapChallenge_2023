30DayMapChallenge2023

Using raster data from the [Gridded Population of the World (GPW)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) v4 dataset from Columbia University, I mapped population changes in Asia from 2020 to 2010.

The R code used to produce the map (tmap) can be found in this repository.
